# Lane-Detection

## Here's the steps to run the Lane-Detection project:

1.  open folder which contains run.sh file
2.  right click then choose git bash here
3.  then type ./run.sh  --src "input_path"  --dst "output_path"  --D 1

where D means debugging mode
0  ---------> means no pipeline outputs will be appear
1  ---------> means pipeline outputs will appear

## Description
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
1. Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
2. Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
3. Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
4. Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
5. Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
